## Theme
Intimate Collaborations, Remotely

## Overview
Meetings, conferences, seminars, and many other collaborative activities are all now held online through meeting applications.
As the number of meeting participants grows larger, it becomes such a pain for stakeholders that have the authority to become the meeting host to make sure everyone is listening to him/her.
But that is no longer a problem, we offer you The Sentinel.


The Sentinel is a third-party application as a supplementary meeting application that has a feature to capture all meeting participant camera views once every certain range of time.
Those pictures are then classified by a machine learning system to determine whether or not a meeting participant is focused on their device screen.
Then the output of the machine learning system (0 for not focus, or 1 for focus) for all meeting participants will be recorded and reported statistically to the meeting host right after the meeting ended.
The meeting host could then use the information from the meeting report to do the decision-making.
